#summary Basic administration options

By default, CSSMatch provides some basic admin options (changelevel, kick, ban, swap, spec). That allows you to not install an administration plugin only for kick and change the map.

If you wish to disable these options, add this line in your autoexec.cfg file :
{{{
cssmatch_advanced 0
}}}
Then reboot your server.
