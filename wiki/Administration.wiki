#summary How to enable the basic administration options ?

By default, the plugin doesn't allow you to administrate the server via the referee menu.

However if you don't wish to keep you administration plugin only for kick and change the level, CSSMatch can provides some basic administration features (changelevel, kick, ban, swap and move to spectator).

To enable these features, add this line in your autoexec.cfg file :
{{{
cssmatch_advanced 1
}}}

Then reboot your server. So the referee menu now displays a new option called "Administration options".
