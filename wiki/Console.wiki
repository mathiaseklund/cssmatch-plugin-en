#summary Declare a referee via the console

Sometimes you would whish to quickly add a referee without have to connect to the FTP and edit the file then change the level...

So there is a command "*cssmatch_grant*". This command allows you to add a referee via RCON.
e.g :
{{{
rcon cssmatch_grant "STEAM_0:1:6823445"
}}}

_*Note :* the steamIDs added with *cssmatch_grant* are automatically removed from the adminlist at the next map change._
