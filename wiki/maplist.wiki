#summary What is the utility of the maplist.txt in the cssmatch folder ?

When you enable the [Administration basic administration options], you can change the level via the referee menu.

_The *maplist.txt* file contains the maps listed in the menu_. This restrict the number of choices in the menu for a faster and easier map change.

Feel free to modify this file ;)
