#summary What is the utility of the maplist.txt in the cssmatch folder?

If the [Administration basic administration options] are enabled, you can change the map via the referee menu.

_The *maplist.txt* file contains the maps listed in the menu_. This restrict the number of choices in the menu for a faster map change.

Feel free to modify this file ;)
